# Question

Question 1 

Analyze your experience with oTree, identifying pain points in behavioral game theory research. Review related literature and class discussions to understand experimental economics' goals. Propose a software solution that outperforms oTree in at least three aspects, enhancing strategic interaction studies. Highlight why these advancements are crucial. Submit a concise essay question answer (500 words max) with your analysis and proposals, backed by literature and class insights. Your innovative ideas can significantly contribute to experimental economics, addressing current limitations and paving the way for advanced research methodologies.

In the analysis, you must provide at least one example of your personal experience in deploying the trust game using oTree, together with a screenshot.

Question 2 

Delve into the limitations of current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks, focusing on environment constraints and agent algorithm customizations. Choose a classic game (e.g., Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, or the Trust Game) to illustrate these limitations. Describe the development process of a MARL agent for your selected game, detailing the definition of states, actions, and rewards grounded in fundamental behavioral assumptions. Your analysis should provide insights into overcoming MARL's current limitations, fostering advancements in the field. Submit a comprehensive report (500 words max) with your findings and proposals.

In the analysis, you must provide at least one example of your personal experience in endeavoring to deploy the gameplay using one of the MARL frameworks, together with a screenshot.

Question 3

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to engage critically with existing research in the field of federated learning, using the specific paper presented by the guest speaker as a primary example. Students will assess the paper's research questions, methodologies, and application scenarios and propose new research ideas addressing the identified limitations or gaps.
